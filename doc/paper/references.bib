	abstract = {The Wells-Riley equation, which is used to model the risk of indoor airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, is sometimes problematic because it assumes steady-state conditions and requires measurement of outdoor air supply rates, which are frequently difficult to measure and often vary with time. We derive an alternative equation that avoids these problems by determining the fraction of inhaled air that has been exhaled previously by someone in the building (rebreathed fraction) using CO2 concentration as a marker for exhaled-breath exposure. We also derive a non-steady-state version of the Wells-Riley equation which is especially useful in poorly ventilated environments when outdoor air supply rates can be assumed constant. Finally, we derive the relationship between the average number of secondary cases infected by each primary case in a building and exposure to exhaled breath and demonstrate that there is likely to be an achievable critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air below which airborne propagation of common respiratory infections and influenza will not occur.},

	abstract = {Background In light of the role that airborne transmission plays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ongoing high global mortality from well-known airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and measles, there is an urgent need for practical ways of identifying congregate spaces where low ventilation levels contribute to high transmission risk. Poorly ventilated clinic spaces in particular may be high risk, due to the presence of both infectious and susceptible people. While relatively simple approaches to estimating ventilation rates exist, the approaches most frequently used in epidemiology cannot be used where occupancy varies, and so cannot be reliably applied in many of the types of spaces where they are most needed. Methods The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a non-steady state method to estimate the absolute ventilation rate, which can be applied in rooms where occupancy levels vary. We used data from a room in a primary healthcare clinic in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, comprising indoor and outdoor carbon dioxide measurements and head counts (by age), taken over time. Two approaches were compared: approach 1 using a simple linear regression model and approach 2 using an ordinary differential equation model. Results The absolute ventilation rate, Q, using approach 1 was 2407 l/s [95\% CI: 1632–3181] and Q from approach 2 was 2743 l/s [95\% CI: 2139–4429]. Conclusions We demonstrate two methods that can be used to estimate ventilation rate in busy congregate settings, such as clinic waiting rooms. Both approaches produced comparable results, however the simple linear regression method has the advantage of not requiring room volume measurements. These methods can be used to identify poorly-ventilated spaces, allowing measures to be taken to reduce the airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells–Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose-response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells–Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose-response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. Practical Implications This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells–Riley and the dose-response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells–Riley model and dose-response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Many scientific reports document that asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of COVID-19, probably during conversations in social interactions. Droplet emission occurs during speech, yet few studies document the flow to provide the transport mechanism. This lack of understanding prevents informed public health guidance for risk reduction and mitigation strategies, e.g., the “6-foot rule.” Here we analyze flows during breathing and speaking, including phonetic features, using orders-of-magnitude estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We document the spatiotemporal structure of the expelled airflow. Phonetic characteristics of plosive sounds like “P” lead to enhanced directed transport, including jet-like flows that entrain the surrounding air. We highlight three distinct temporal scaling laws for the transport distance of exhaled material including 1) transport over a short distance ({\textless}
{\textless}
0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with large angular variations due to the complexity of speech; 2) a longer distance, ∼1 m, where directed transport is driven by individual vortical puffs corresponding to plosive sounds; and 3) a distance out to about 2 m, or even farther, where sequential plosives in a sentence, corresponding effectively to a train of puffs, create conical, jet-like flows. The latter dictates the long-time transport in a conversation. We believe that this work will inform thinking about the role of ventilation, aerosol transport in disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better understanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerophonetics.},

Four lung capacities are also defined: inspiratory capacity, vital capacity, functional residual capacity, and the total lung capacity. Pulmonary ventilation is the product of tidal volume and respiratory frequency. The maximum voluntary ventilation is the maximum air that can be moved per minute. Spirometry also provides a measure of airway resistance by use of the forced expiratory volume test. The clinical spirogram presents the forced vital capacity differently. In laminar flow, pressure necessary to drive flow increases linearly with the flow. In turbulent flow, pressure increases with the square of the flow. The Reynolds number is used to estimate whether flow is laminar or turbulent. Airway resistance also increases inversely with lung volume because stretch of the lungs opens airways. Dynamic compression limits flow at high expiratory effort.},

	abstract = {Background Despite an improvement in the overall TB cure rate from 40–74\% between 1995 and 2011, TB incidence in South Africa continues to increase. The epidemic is notably disquieting in schools because the vulnerable population is compelled to be present. Older learners (age 15–19) are at particular risk given a smear-positive rate of 427 per 100,000 per year and the significant amount of time they spend indoors. High schools are therefore important locations for potential TB infection and thus prevention efforts. Methods and Findings Using portable carbon dioxide monitors, we measured CO2 in classrooms under non-steady state conditions. The threshold for tuberculosis transmission was estimated using a carbon dioxide-based risk equation. We determined a critical rebreathed fraction of carbon dioxide () of 1·6\%, which correlates with an indoor CO2 concentration of 1000 ppm. These values correspond with a ventilation rate of 8·6 l/s per person or 12 air exchanges per hour (ACH) for standard classrooms of 180 m3. Conclusions Given the high smear positive rate of high-school adolescents in South Africa, the proposal to achieve CO2 levels of 1000ppm through natural ventilation (in the amount 12 ACH) will not only help achieve WHO guidelines for providing children with healthy indoor environments, it will also provide a low-cost intervention for helping control the TB epidemic in areas of high prevalence.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed major gaps in our understanding of the transmission of viruses through the air. These gaps slowed recognition of airborne transmission of the disease, contributed to muddled public health policies and impeded clear messaging on how best to slow transmission of COVID-19. In particular, current recommendations have been based on four tenets: (i) respiratory disease transmission routes can be viewed mostly in a binary manner of ‘droplets’ versus ‘aerosols’; (ii) this dichotomy depends on droplet size alone; (iii) the cut-off size between these routes of transmission is 5 µm; and (iv) there is a dichotomy in the distance at which transmission by each route is relevant. Yet, a relationship between these assertions is not supported by current scientific knowledge. Here, we revisit the historical foundation of these notions, and how they became entangled from the 1800s to today, with a complex interplay among various fields of science and medicine. This journey into the past highlights potential solutions for better collaboration and integration of scientific results into practice for building a more resilient society with more sound, far-sighted and effective public health policies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses consists of three sequential steps: (1) release of respiratory fluids in the form of droplets from the nose and mouth of an infected person, (2) transport of the droplets through air, and (3) entry of the droplets into the nose and mouth of an uninfected individual. Talking, coughing, and sneezing emit droplets across a spectrum of sizes. The water in exhaled droplets begins to evaporate in air and, as a result, the droplets are reduced in size shortly after being emitted. Face masks are effective for capturing droplets just released from the nose and mouth. Studies indicate that more than 50\% of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. Use of face masks by the public can effectively reduce the chance of infected individuals unknowingly spreading the virus. In addition to being an effective device for source control, face masks can protect the wearers from inhaling virus-laden droplets. Cloth masks and disposable masks provide reasonable protection for the public, while surgical masks and N95 respirators give higher levels of protection as needed in healthcare settings. Made with varied materials, these masks have different structural characteristics. The collection efficiency of a face mask depends on droplet size, face velocity, and the structural characteristics of the mask. For a given mask, capturing droplets is more effective during exhalation than during inhalation. Pressure drop across the mask should be taken into consideration when selecting a face mask. The best face mask is the one that gives the highest collection efficiency with the least pressure drop. For an effective protection, a mask should fit the face properly. While face masks have proven adequate in reducing airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections, continuous improvement is needed to better prepare for future respiratory viral threats.},

	abstract = {The nature and airborne dispersion of the underestimated biological agents, monitoring, analysis and transmission among the human occupants into building environment is a major challenge of today. Those agents play a crucial role in ensuring comfortable, healthy and risk-free conditions into indoor working and leaving spaces. It is known that ventilation systems influence strongly the transmission of indoor air pollutants, with scarce information although to have been reported for biological agents until 2019. The biological agents’ source release and the trajectory of airborne transmission are both important in terms of optimising the design of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems of the future. In addition, modelling via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will become a more valuable tool in foreseeing risks and tackle hazards when pollutants and biological agents released into closed spaces. Promising results on the prediction of their dispersion routes and concentration levels, as well as the selection of the appropriate ventilation strategy, provide crucial information on risk minimisation of the airborne transmission among humans. Under this context, the present multidisciplinary review considers four interrelated aspects of the dispersion of biological agents in closed spaces, (a) the nature and airborne transmission route of the examined agents, (b) the biological origin and health effects of the major microbial pathogens on the human respiratory system, (c) the role of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in the airborne transmission and (d) the associated computer modelling approaches. This adopted methodology allows the discussion of the existing findings, on-going research, identification of the main research gaps and future directions from a multidisciplinary point of view which will be helpful for substantial innovations in the field.},

	abstract = {A susceptible person experiences the highest exposure risk of respiratory infection when he or she is in close proximity with an infected person. The large droplet route has been commonly believed to be dominant for most respiratory infections since the early 20th century, and the associated droplet precaution is widely known and practiced in hospitals and in the community. The mechanism of exposure to droplets expired at close contact, however, remains surprisingly unexplored. In this study, the exposure to exhaled droplets during close contact ({\textless}2 m) via both the short-range airborne and large droplet sub-routes is studied using a simple mathematical model of expired flows and droplet dispersion/deposition/inhalation, which enables the calculation of exposure due to both deposition and inhalation. The short-range airborne route is found to dominate at most distances studied during both talking and coughing.

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic, there has been a lack of data to quantify the role played by breathing-out of pathogens in the spread of SARS-Cov-2 despite sufficient indication of its culpability. This work aims to establish the role of aerosol dispersion of SARS-Cov-2 virus and similar airborne pathogens on the spread of the disease in enclosed spaces. A steady-state fluid solver is used to simulate the air flow field, which is then used to compute the dispersion of SARS-Cov-2 and spatial probability distribution of infection inside two representative classrooms. In particular, the dependence of the turbulent diffusivity of the passive scalar on the air changes per hour and the number of inlet ducts has been given due consideration. By mimicking the presence of several humans in an enclosed space with a time-periodic inhalation–exhalation cycle, this study firmly establishes breathing as a major contributor in the spread of the pathogen, especially by superspreaders. Second, a spatial gradient of pathogen concentration is established inside the domain, which strongly refutes the well-mixed theory. Furthermore, higher ventilation rates and proximity of the infected person to the inlet and exhaust vents play an important role in determining the spread of the pathogen. In the case of classrooms, a ventilation rate equivalent to 9 air changes or more is recommended. The simulations show that the “one-meter distance rule” between the occupants can significantly reduce the risk of spreading infection by a high-emitter.},

This paper reviews the use of CO2 as a “natural” tracer gas for estimating VRs, focusing on applications in school classrooms. It provides details and guidance for the steady-state, build-up, decay and transient mass balance methods. An extension to the build-up method and an analysis of the post-exercise recovery period that can increase CO2 generation rates are presented. Measurements in four mechanically-ventilated school buildings demonstrate the methods and highlight issues affecting their applicability. VRs during the school day fell below recommended minimum levels, and VRs during evening and early morning were on the order of 0.1 h−1, reflecting shutdown of the ventilation systems. The transient mass balance method was the most flexible and advantageous method given the low air change rates and dynamic occupancy patterns observed in the classrooms. While the extension to the build-up method improved stability and consistency, the accuracy of this and the steady-state method may be limited. Decay-based methods did not reflect the VR during the school day due to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system shutdown. Since the number of occupants in classrooms changes over the day, the VR expressed on a per person basis (e.g., L·s−1·person−1) depends on the occupancy metric. If occupancy measurements can be obtained, then the transient mass balance method likely will provide the most consistent and accurate results among the CO2-based methods. Improved VR measurements can benefit many applications, including research examining the linkage between ventilation and health.},

The epidemic was notable because of lts explosive nature and lts occurrence In a school where 97\% of the children had been vaccinated. Many had been vaccinated at less than one year of age.

From estimates of major physical and biologic factors, It was possible to calculate that the lndex case produced approximately 93 units of airborne lnfection (quanta) per minute.

In either case, an accurate estimation of dose and sites of deposition in the respiratory tract is fundamental to understanding subsequent biological response, and the basic physics of particle motion and engineering knowledge needed to understand these subjects is the topic of this chapter., A large portion of this chapter deals with three fundamental areas necessary to the understanding of particle transport and deposition in the respiratory tract.

	url = {https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechBOOK:1988.001},
	abstract = {Analysis and abatement of air pollution involve a variety of technical disciplines. Formation of the most prevalent pollutants occurs during the combustion process, a tightly coupled system involving fluid flow, mass and energy transport, and chemical kinetics. Its complexity is exemplified by the fact that, in many respects, the simplest hydrocarbon combustion, the methane-oxygen flame, has been quantitatively modeled only within the last several years. Nonetheless, the development of combustion modifications aimed at minimizing the formation of the unwanted by-products of burning fuels requires an understanding of the combustion process. Fuel may be available in solid, liquid, or gaseous form; it may be mixed with the air ahead of time or only within the combustion chamber; the chamber itself may vary from the piston and cylinder arrangement in an automobile engine to a 10-story-high boiler in the largest power plant; the unwanted byproducts may remain as gases, or they may, upon cooling, form small particles. 

The only effective way to control air pollution is to prevent the release of pollutants at the source. Where pollutants are generated in combustion, modifications to the combustion process itself, for example in the manner in which the fuel and air are mixed, can be quite effective in reducing their formation. Most situations, whether a combustion or an industrial process, however, require some degree of treatment of the exhaust gases before they are released to the atmosphere. Such treatment can involve intimately contacting the effluent gases with liquids or solids capable of selectively removing gaseous pollutants or, in the case of particulate pollutants, directing the effluent flow through a device in which the particles are captured on surfaces. 

The study of the generation and control of air pollutants can be termed air pollution engineering and is the subject of this book. Our goal here is to present a rigorous and fundamental analysis of the production of air pollutants and their control. The book is intended for use at the senior or first-year graduate level in chemical, civil, environmental, and mechanical engineering curricula. We assume that the student has had basic first courses in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. The material treated in the book can serve as the subject of either a full-year or a one-term course, depending on the choice of topics covered. 

In the first chapter we introduce the concept of air pollution engineering and summarize those species classified as air pollutants. Chapter 1 also contains four appendices that present certain basic material that will be called upon later in the book. This material includes chemical kinetics, the basic equations of heat and mass transfer, and some elementary ideas from probability and turbulence. 

Chapter 2 is a basic treatment of combustion, including its chemistry and the role of mixing processes and flame structure. Building on the foundation laid in Chapter 2, we present in Chapter 3 a comprehensive analysis of the formation of gaseous pollutants in combustion. Continuing in this vein, Chapter 4 contains a thorough treatment of the internal combustion engine, including its principles of operation and the mechanisms of formation of pollutants therein. Control methods based on combustion modification are discussed in both Chapters 3 and 4. 

Particulate matter (aerosols) constitutes the second major category of air pollutants when classified on the basis of physical state. Chapter 5 is devoted to an introduction to aerosols and principles of aerosol behavior, including the mechanics of particles in flowing fluids, the migration of particles in external force fields, Brownian motion of small particles, size distributions, coagulation, and formation of new particles from the vapor by homogeneous nucleation. Chapter 6 then treats the formation of particles in combustion processes. 

Chapters 7 and 8 present the basic theories of the removal of particulate and gaseous pollutants, respectively, from effluent streams. We cover all the major air pollution control operations, such as gravitational and centrifugal deposition, electrostatic precipitation, filtration, wet scrubbing, gas absorption and adsorption, and chemical reaction methods. Our goal in these two chapters, above all, is to carefully derive the basic equations governing the design of the control methods. Limited attention is given to actual equipment specification, although with the material in Chapters 7 and 8 serving as a basis, one will be able to proceed to design handbooks for such specifications. 

Chapters 2 through 8 treat air pollution engineering from a process-by-process point of view. Chapter 9 views the air pollution control problem for an entire region or airshed. To comply with national ambient air quality standards that prescribe, on the basis of health effects, the maximum atmospheric concentration level to be attained in a region, it is necessary for the relevant governmental authority to specify the degree to which the emissions from each of the sources in the region must be controlled. Thus it is generally necessary to choose among many alternatives that may lead to the same total quantity of emission over the region. Chapter 9 establishes a framework by which an optimal air pollution control plan for an airshed may be determined. In short, we seek the least-cost combination of abatement measures that meets the necessary constraint that the total emissions not exceed those required to meet an ambient air quality standard. 

Once pollutants are released into the atmosphere, they are acted on by a variety of chemical and physical phenomena. The atmospheric chemistry and physics of air pollution is indeed a rich arena, encompassing the disciplines of chemistry, meteorology, fluid mechanics, and aerosol science. As noted above, the subject matter of the present book ends at the stack (or the tailpipe); those readers desiring a treatment of the atmospheric behavior of air pollutants are referred to J. H. Seinfeld, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics of Air Pollution (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1986). 

We wish to gratefully acknowledge David Huang, Carol Jones, Sonya Kreidenweis, Ranajit Sahu, and Ken Wolfenbarger for their assistance with calculations in the book.
Finally, to Christina Conti, our secretary and copy editor, who, more than anyone else, kept safe the beauty and precision of language as an effective means of communication, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. She nurtured this book as her own; through those times when the task seemed unending, she was always there to make the road a little smoother.

We consider one asymptomatic or presymptomatic infectious person breathing or talking, with or without a mask, and model a quasi-three-dimensional set-up that incorporates a recirculating air-conditioning flow. We derive a semi-analytic solution that enables fast simulations and compare our predictions to three real-life case studies—a courtroom, a restaurant, and a hospital ward—demonstrating good agreement. We then generate predictions for the concentration and the infection risk in a classroom, for four different ventilation settings. We quantify the significant reduction in the concentration and the infection risk as ventilation improves, and derive appropriate power laws. The model can be easily updated for different parameter values and can be used to make predictions on the expected time taken to become infected, for any location, emission rate, and ventilation level.

	abstract = {A 2-week intensive measurement campaign of indoor and outdoor air pollution was carried out in September 2006, in a primary school to investigate indoor–outdoor correlations of particle number (PN) concentrations, and the impact of air exchange rate (ACH) on the indoor PN concentration. The ACHs in the classroom for different conditions associated with window opening and the operational status of air conditioners (A/C) and fans were tested. As expected, the lowest ACH (0.12h−1) was found when the windows were closed and A/C and fans were off. In contrast, the highest ACH (7.92h−1) was observed when the windows were opened and A/C and fans were all on. The analysis of the PN I/O ratios at different ACHs in the absence of indoor sources indicates that the mean I/O ratio was 0.621±0.007 (mean±95\% confidence interval) when the windows were closed, and A/C and fans were off; 0.524±0.023 when windows were closed, fans were off and A/C was on; and 0.502±0.029 when windows were closed, A/C was off and fans were on. To further understand the relationship between indoor and outdoor PN concentrations, the impact of outdoor PN concentration on I/O ratios at different ACHs was investigated. It was found that the relationship between outdoor PN concentration and the I/O ratio at different ACHs followed a power trendline with an equation of I/O ratio=APNout−b (A and b are coefficients, PNout is outdoor PN concentration), suggesting that the penetration efficiency decreased with increasing outdoor PN concentration. It is the first time we found that when the outdoor PN concentration increased there was an associated increase in the concentration of nano-particles, which have been demonstrated to have higher deposition rates and lower penetration efficiencies. Based on the above equation, the study also showed a significant effect of ACH on indoor PN concentrations under stable outdoor PN concentrations. In general, the higher the ACH was, the lower the indoor PN concentration was.},

	abstract = {Turbulent or eddy diffusion models are used to predict spatially resolved exposures to toxic airborne materials in indoor environments. The single parameter that governs mixing in these models is the eddy diffusion coefficient. Some relationships that enable this coefficient to be predicted have been proposed in the literature, but wider applicability of these has not previously been tested. In this paper an automated computational fluid dynamics tool was used to calculate the eddy diffusion coefficient in a range of isothermal, mechanically ventilated rooms. Available models for the diffusion coefficient were then tested and the most applicable was found to be one based on a turbulent kinetic energy balance. This relationship was only appropriate when the characteristic length was set to a dimension of the air supply inlet, instead of the length usually applied, i.e. the room height. The validity of this relationship was further demonstrated using experimental test cases and by applying standard error metrics. The eddy diffusion approach can now be used with improved confidence in a wider range of scenarios than was possible before.},

	abstract = {One major approach to modeling dispersion of pollutants inside confined spaces describes the turbulent transport of material as the product of an eddy diffusivity and the local concentration gradient. This paper examines the applicability of this eddy diffusivity/gradient model by (1) describing the conditions under which this approach is an appropriate representation of turbulent transport, and (2) re‐analysis of data provided in studies that have successfully applied gradient transport to describe tracer concentrations. We find that the solutions of the mass conservation equation based on gradient transport provide adequate descriptions of concentration measurements from two studies representative of two types of sources: instantaneous and continuous release of aerosols. We then provide the rationale for the empirical success of the gradient transport model. The solutions of the gradient transport model allow us to examine the relationship between the ventilation rate and the spatial and temporal behavior of the dose of material associated with aerosol releases in a room. We conclude with the associated implications on mitigation of exposure to aerosols such as airborne virus or bacteria.},

	abstract = {Natural human exhalation flows such as coughing, sneezing and breathing can be considered as ‘jet-like’ airflows in the sense that they are produced from a single source in a single exhalation effort, with a relatively symmetrical, conical geometry. Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose – nasally, and through the mouth - orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.5±6.36 years; 4 men: 29.25±10.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m2. The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m2/s. For nasal breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.11 m2 and 0.16 m2/s, respectively. Similarly, for mouth breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.8 m and 1.3 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.18 m2 and 0.17 m2/s, respectively. Surprisingly, a comparison of the maximum exit velocities of sneezing reported here with those obtained from coughing (published previously) demonstrated that they are relatively similar, and not extremely high. This is in contrast with some earlier estimates of sneeze velocities, and some reasons for this difference are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objectives We compared the expelled air dispersion distances during coughing from a human patient simulator (HPS) lying at 45° with and without wearing a surgical mask or N95 mask in a negative pressure isolation room. Methods Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. Coughing bouts were generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650, 320, and 220L/min to simulate normal, mild and poor coughing efforts, respectively. The coughing jet was revealed by laser light-sheet and images were captured by high definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Significant exposure was arbitrarily defined where there was ≥ 20\% of normalized smoke concentration. Results During normal cough, expelled air dispersion distances were 68, 30 and 15 cm along the median sagittal plane when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. In moderate lung injury, the corresponding air dispersion distances for mild coughing efforts were reduced to 55, 27 and 14 cm, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001. The distances were reduced to 30, 24 and 12 cm, respectively during poor coughing effort as in severe lung injury. Lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 0, 28 and 15 cm when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. Conclusions Normal cough produced a turbulent jet about 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent subject. N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage.},

	abstract = {Various infectious agents are known to be transmitted naturally via respiratory aerosols produced by infected patients. Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).},

	abstract = {The CDC recommends that healthcare settings provide influenza patients with facemasks as a means of reducing transmission to staff and other patients, and a recent report suggested that surgical masks can capture influenza virus in large droplet spray. However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza. We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (“coarse”{\textgreater}5 µm, “fine”≤5 µm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95\% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95\% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95\% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95\% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r = 0.17, coarse; r = 0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples. Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans.},

Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.},

	abstract = {Background
Since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, scientific exploration of infection control is no longer restricted to microbiologists or medical scientists. Many studies have reported on the release, transport, and exposure of expiratory droplets because of respiratory activities. This review focuses on the airborne spread of infectious agents from mucus to mucus in the indoor environment and their spread as governed by airflows in the respiratory system, around people, and in buildings at different transport stages.
Methods
We critically review the literature on the release of respiratory droplets, their transport and dispersion in the indoor environment, and the ultimate exposure of a susceptible host, as influenced by airflows.
Results
These droplets or droplet nuclei are transported by expired airflows, which are sometimes affected by the human body plume and use of a face mask, as well as room airflow. Room airflow is affected by human activities such as walking and door opening, and some droplets are eventually captured by a susceptible individual because of his or her inspired flows; such exposure can eventually lead to long-range spread of airborne pathogens. Direct exposure to the expired fine droplets or droplet nuclei results in short-range airborne transmission. Deposition of droplets and direct personal exposure to expired large droplets can lead to the fomite route and the droplet-borne route, respectively.
Conclusions
We have shown the opportunities for infection control at different stages of the spread. We propose that the short-range airborne route may be important in close contact, and its control may be achieved by face masks for the source patients and use of personalized ventilation. Our discussion of the effect of thermal stratification and expiratory delivery of droplets leads to the suggestion that displacement ventilation may not be applicable to hospital rooms where respiratory infection is a concern.},

	abstract = {Background: Placing a surgical mask on an infected patient (respiratory source control) may offer a health-care worker (HCW) more protection than donning an N95 respirator (receiver protection). This observation was made in an in vitro study that used hard, nondeformable faces, and the lack of proper N95 fit may have accounted for the observed results. In the present study, we test the effects of fit on respiratory source control protection, using a soft, deformable mannequin head.

Methods: Resusci Anne CPR mannequin heads were placed in a chamber allowing 6 air exchanges/hr (14 cubic feet per minute), to simulate an infected patient (source) and an HCW (receiver). The heads were ventilated with a tidal breathing pattern. The source exhaled radioactive aerosols, and a filter was attached to the receiver to quantify inhaled exposure. N95 respirators and surgical masks were tested on both heads. The degree of protection was expressed by calculating the reduction in exposure expressed as a simulated workplace protection factor (sWPF; the ratio of exposure with mask to exposure without mask) compared statistically using confidence intervals.

Results: Use of the Resusci Anne heads resulted in improved fit, with higher sWPF than previously reported, for example, for source N95 mask combinations (7,174 vs. 317) as well as receiver (7.53 vs. 1.37). Masks placed on the receiver provided minimal exposure protection (sWPF range 0.99–7.53), except when sealed with Vaseline (sWPF 63.1). Any mask applied to the source mannequin resulted in significant reductions in exposure (sWPF range 214–17,038).

Conclusion: Improved fit significantly enhanced the effects of source control protection. A Vaseline-sealed N95 respirator on the receiver offered less protection when compared with any mask on the source. Respiratory source control can offer more protection to HCW and potentially decrease the spread of aerosolized infections.},

We examined aerosol and indirect contact in transmission of rhinovirus type 16 colds between laboratory-infected men (donors) and susceptible men (recipients) who played cards together for 12 hr. In three experiments the infection rate of restrained recipients (10 [56\%] of 18), who could not touch their faces and could only have been infected by aerosols, and that of unrestrained recipients (12[67\%] of 18), who could have been infected by aerosol, by direct contact, or by indirect fomite contact, was not significantly different (chi 2 = 0.468, P = .494). In a fourth experiment, transmission via fomites heavily used for 12 hr by eight donors was the only possible route of spread, and no transmissions occurred among 12 recipients (P less than .001 by two-tailed Fisher's exact test). These results suggest that contrary to current opinion, rhinovirus transmission, at least in adults, occurs chiefly by the aerosol route.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Considerable controversy exists with regard to whether influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are spread by the inhalation of infectious airborne particles and about the importance of this route, compared with droplet or contact transmission.
METHODS: Airborne particles were collected in an urgent care clinic with use of stationary and personal aerosol samplers. The amounts of airborne influenza A, influenza B, and RSV RNA were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Health care workers and patients participating in the study were tested for influenza.
RESULTS: Seventeen percent of the stationary samplers contained influenza A RNA, 1\% contained influenza B RNA, and 32\% contained RSV RNA. Nineteen percent of the personal samplers contained influenza A RNA, none contained influenza B RNA, and 38\% contained RSV RNA. The number of samplers containing influenza RNA correlated well with the number and location of patients with influenza (r= 0.77). Forty-two percent of the influenza A RNA was in particles {\textless} or = 4.1 microm in aerodynamic diameter, and 9\% of the RSV RNA was in particles {\textless} or = 4.1 microm.
CONCLUSIONS: Airborne particles containing influenza and RSV RNA were detected throughout a health care facility. The particles were small enough to remain airborne for an extended time and to be inhaled deeply into the respiratory tract. These results support the possibility that influenza and RSV can be transmitted by the airborne route and suggest that further investigation of the potential of these particles to transmit infection is warranted.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious pathogen with a huge global health impact. It is a major cause of hospital-acquired infection; a large number of those exposed develop infection. Those infected in hospital are at increased risk of a severe clinical course. Prevention of nosocomial spread currently focuses on spread by hand and large droplets. There is little research evidence to determine if aerosol spread of infectious RSV is possible.
OBJECTIVES: To determine if the air surrounding infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis contains RSV in aerosolized particles that remain capable of causing infection.
METHODS: The amount of RSV contained in aerosolized particles produced by infants with bronchiolitis due to RSV was measured using viable impactor sampling. The ability of RSV contained in these particles to infect healthy and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) human ciliated respiratory epithelium was determined.
RESULTS: We showed for the first time that infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis nursed in a ward setting or ventilated in intensive care produced large numbers of aerosol particles containing RSV that remained infectious and were capable of infecting healthy and COPD human ciliated epithelium. A significant amount of RSV was found in particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 5 μm.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the aerosolized particles that contained RSV in the air surrounding infants with bronchiolitis were sufficiently small to remain airborne for a significant length of time and small enough to be inhaled and deposited throughout the respiratory tract. It is likely that this leads to spread of infection to others, with dissemination of infection throughout the respiratory tract.},

We assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols. We recovered infectious virus from 52 (39\%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89\%) of the NP swabs with valid cultures. The geometric mean RNA copy numbers were 3.8 × 104/30-minutes fine-, 1.2 × 104/30-minutes coarse-aerosol sample, and 8.2 × 108 per NP swab. Fine- and coarse-aerosol viral RNA were positively associated with body mass index and number of coughs and negatively associated with increasing days since symptom onset in adjusted models. Fine-aerosol viral RNA was also positively associated with having influenza vaccination for both the current and prior season. NP swab viral RNA was positively associated with upper respiratory symptoms and negatively associated with age but was not significantly associated with fine- or coarse-aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing was rare, and sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation. Our observations suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and independent.},

	abstract = {Patients with influenza release aerosol particles containing the virus into their environment. However, the importance of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza is unclear, in part because of a lack of information about the infectivity of the airborne virus. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of viable influenza A virus that was expelled by patients in aerosol particles while coughing. Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA). Viable influenza A virus was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 7 of these 17 test subjects (41\%). Viable influenza A virus was found in the smallest particle size fraction (0.3 μm to 8 μm), with a mean of 142 plaque-forming units (SD 215) expelled during the 6 coughs in particles of this size. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amounts of influenza A detected in cough aerosol particles during our experiments were relatively low, larger quantities could be expelled by influenza patients during a pandemic when illnesses would be more severe. Our findings support the idea that airborne infectious particles could play an important role in the spread of influenza.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Defining dispersal of influenza virus via aerosol is essential for the development of prevention measures.
METHODS: During the 2010-2011 influenza season, subjects with influenza-like illness were enrolled in an emergency department and throughout a tertiary care hospital, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained, and symptom severity, treatment, and medical history were recorded. Quantitative impaction air samples were taken not ≤0.305 m (1 foot), 0.914 m (3 feet), and 1.829 m (6 feet) from the patient's head during routine care. Influenza virus was detected by rapid test and polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Sixty-one of 94 subjects (65\%) tested positive for influenza virus. Twenty-six patients (43\%) released influenza virus into room air, with 5 (19\%) emitting up to 32 times more virus than others. Emitters surpassed the airborne 50\% human infectious dose of influenza virus at all sample locations. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) were exposed to mainly small influenza virus particles (diameter, {\textless}4.7 µm), with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the patient's head (P {\textless} .05). Influenza virus release was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples (shedding), coughing, and sneezing (P {\textless} .05). Patients who reported severe illness and major interference with daily life also emitted more influenza virus (P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSIONS: HCPs within 1.829 m of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols. This finding questions the current paradigm of localized droplet transmission during non-aerosol-generating procedures.},

	abstract = {Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized, the condition of ventilation for its occurrence is still being debated. We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 1 L/s per person.},
