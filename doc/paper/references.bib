	abstract = {The Wells-Riley equation, which is used to model the risk of indoor airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, is sometimes problematic because it assumes steady-state conditions and requires measurement of outdoor air supply rates, which are frequently difficult to measure and often vary with time. We derive an alternative equation that avoids these problems by determining the fraction of inhaled air that has been exhaled previously by someone in the building (rebreathed fraction) using CO2 concentration as a marker for exhaled-breath exposure. We also derive a non-steady-state version of the Wells-Riley equation which is especially useful in poorly ventilated environments when outdoor air supply rates can be assumed constant. Finally, we derive the relationship between the average number of secondary cases infected by each primary case in a building and exposure to exhaled breath and demonstrate that there is likely to be an achievable critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air below which airborne propagation of common respiratory infections and influenza will not occur.},

	abstract = {Background Elevated rates of tuberculosis in healthcare workers demonstrate the high rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in health facilities in high-burden settings. In the context of a project taking a whole systems approach to tuberculosis infection prevention and control (IPC), we aimed to evaluate the potential impact of conventional and novel IPC measures on Mtb transmission to patients and other clinic attendees.
Methods An individual-based model of patient movements through clinics, ventilation in waiting areas, and Mtb transmission was developed, and parameterised using empirical data from eight clinics in two provinces in South Africa. Seven interventions—codeveloped with health professionals and policy-makers—were simulated: (1) queue management systems with outdoor waiting areas, (2) ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems, (3) appointment systems, (4) opening windows and doors, (5) surgical mask wearing by clinic attendees, (6) simple clinic retrofits and (7) increased coverage of long antiretroviral therapy prescriptions and community medicine collection points through the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) service.
Results In the model, (1) outdoor waiting areas reduced the transmission to clinic attendees by 83\% (IQR 76\%–88\%), (2) UVGI by 77\% (IQR 64\%–85\%), (3) appointment systems by 62\% (IQR 45\%–75\%), (4) opening windows and doors by 55\% (IQR 25\%–72\%), (5) masks by 47\% (IQR 42\%–50\%), (6) clinic retrofits by 45\% (IQR 16\%–64\%) and (7) increasing the coverage of CCMDD by 22\% (IQR 12\%–32\%).
Conclusions The majority of the interventions achieved median reductions in the rate of transmission to clinic attendees of at least 45\%, meaning that a range of highly effective intervention options are available, that can be tailored to the local context. Measures that are not traditionally considered to be IPC interventions, such as appointment systems, may be as effective as more traditional IPC measures, such as mask wearing.},

We used input data derived from an actual TB exposure on an airliner, and we assumed a hypothetical scenario that a highly infectious TB source case (i.e., 108 infectious quanta per hour) travels as a passenger on an 8.7-hour flight. We estimate an average risk of TB transmission on the order of 1 chance in 1,000 for all passengers using the OBM. Applying the more realistic SBM, we show that the risk and incidence decrease sharply in a stepwise fashion in cabins downstream from the cabin containing the source case assuming some potential for airflow from more contaminated to less contaminated cabins. We further characterized spatial variability in the risk within the cabin by modeling a previously reported TB outbreak in an airplane to demonstrate that the TB cases occur most likely within close proximity of the source TB patient.},

	abstract = {Background The current understanding of airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission is based on classic 1950s studies in which guinea pigs were exposed to air from a tuberculosis ward. Recently we recreated this model in Lima, Perú, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. Methods and Findings All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 8.5\% of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98\% of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90\% of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. Conclusions A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB drug-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat.},

Drawing upon social interaction data and carbon dioxide measurements from a South African township, we created an age-structured model of tuberculosis transmission in households, public transit, schools, and workplaces. We fit the model to local data on latent tuberculosis prevalence by age.Results. Most tuberculosis infections (84\%) were estimated to occur outside of one's own household. Fifty percent of infections among young adults (ages 15–19) occurred in schools, due to high contact rates and poor ventilation. Despite lower numbers of contacts in workplaces, assortative mixing among adults with high rates of smear-positive tuberculosis contributed to transmission in this environment. Households and public transit were important sites of transmission between age groups.Conclusions. Consistent with molecular epidemiologic estimates, a minority of tuberculosis transmission was estimated to occur within households, which may limit the impact of contact investigations. Further work is needed to investigate the role of schools in tuberculosis transmission.},

Organisms were enumerated in the bacterial slurries before and after nebulization in a Collison nebulizer, in air samples from the equipment during nebulization, and in the lungs of animals killed at various intervals after exposure. A Goldberg rotating drum was used to test the ability of the organisms to survive aerial suspension.

The mycobacteria withstood aerosolization and aerial suspension about equally well and were found in equivalent numbers in lungs from animals killed immediately after exposure. The numbers of organisms in lungs of animals killed three days later were approximately the same, but thereafter lung clearance rates varied considerably. By the eleventh day, the atypical mycobacteria had been reduced in numbers (with the exception of the photochromogenic organism, P8), but the typical tubercle bacilli had multiplied.

These observations show that the difference between M. tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria with respect to transmission of disease resides in the host-parasite relationship after implantation rather than in a variation in capacity for aerial transmission or deposition after inhalation.},

We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, along with previous literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d⩽20μm) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100μm), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the individuals, who have been tested positive on COVID-19, could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D scale-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give various examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d⩽20μm) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modelling. The developed model takes into account the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, ’exposure time’ to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional ’safety distance’ thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte-Carlo simulations, along with the theory, provide clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.},

This paper reviews the use of CO2 as a “natural” tracer gas for estimating VRs, focusing on applications in school classrooms. It provides details and guidance for the steady-state, build-up, decay and transient mass balance methods. An extension to the build-up method and an analysis of the post-exercise recovery period that can increase CO2 generation rates are presented. Measurements in four mechanically-ventilated school buildings demonstrate the methods and highlight issues affecting their applicability. VRs during the school day fell below recommended minimum levels, and VRs during evening and early morning were on the order of 0.1 h−1, reflecting shutdown of the ventilation systems. The transient mass balance method was the most flexible and advantageous method given the low air change rates and dynamic occupancy patterns observed in the classrooms. While the extension to the build-up method improved stability and consistency, the accuracy of this and the steady-state method may be limited. Decay-based methods did not reflect the VR during the school day due to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system shutdown. Since the number of occupants in classrooms changes over the day, the VR expressed on a per person basis (e.g., L·s−1·person−1) depends on the occupancy metric. If occupancy measurements can be obtained, then the transient mass balance method likely will provide the most consistent and accurate results among the CO2-based methods. Improved VR measurements can benefit many applications, including research examining the linkage between ventilation and health.},

Using patient and environmental data, we studied transmission at a primary care clinic in South Africa.We collected patient movements, cough frequency, and clinical data, and measured indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, relative humidity, and Mtb genomes in the air. We used negative binomial regression model to investigate associations.We analyzed 978 unique patients who contributed 14 795 data points. The median patient age was 33 (interquartile range [IQR], 26–41) years, and 757 (77.4\%) were female. Overall, median CO2 levels were 564 (IQR 495–646) parts per million and were highest in the morning. Median number of coughs per day was 466 (IQR, 368–503), and overall median Mtb DNA copies/μL/day was 4.2 (IQR, 1.2–9.5). We found an increased presence of Mtb DNA in the air of 32\% (95\% credible interval, 7\%–63\%) per 100 additional young adults (aged 15–29 years) and 1\% (0–2\%) more Mtb DNA per 10\% increase of relative humidity. Estimated cumulative transmission risks for patients attending the clinic monthly for at least 1 hour range between 9\% and 29\%.We identified young adults and relative humidity as potentially important factors for transmission risks in healthcare clinics. Our approach should be used to detect transmission and evaluate infection control interventions.},

The epidemic was notable because of lts explosive nature and lts occurrence In a school where 97\% of the children had been vaccinated. Many had been vaccinated at less than one year of age. The Index case was a girl In second grade who produced 28 secondary cases in 14 different classrooms. Organisms reclrculated by the ventilating system were strongly Implicated. After two subsequent generations, 60 children had been Infected, and the epidemic subsided. From estimates of major physical and biologic factors, It was possible to calculate that the lndex case produced approximately 93 units of airborne lnfection (quanta) per minute. The epidemic pattern suggested that the secondaries were less Infectious by an order of magnitude. The exceptional Infectiousness of the Index case, lnadequate Immunization of many of the children, and the high percentage of air reclrculated throughout the school, are believed to account for the extent and sharpness of the outbreak.},

	abstract = {Background Growing evidence suggests an important contribution of airborne transmission to the overall spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in particular via smaller particles called aerosols. However, the contribution of school children to SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess transmission of airborne respiratory infections and the association with infection control measures in schools using a multiple-measurement approach. Methods and findings We collected epidemiological (cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)), environmental (CO2, aerosol and particle concentrations), and molecular data (bioaerosol and saliva samples) over 7 weeks from January to March 2022 (Omicron wave) in 2 secondary schools (n = 90, average 18 students/classroom) in Switzerland. We analyzed changes in environmental and molecular characteristics between different study conditions (no intervention, mask wearing, air cleaners). Analyses of environmental changes were adjusted for different ventilation, the number of students in class, school and weekday effects. We modeled disease transmission using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model, adjusting for absent students and community transmission. Molecular analysis of saliva (21/262 positive) and airborne samples (10/130) detected SARS-CoV-2 throughout the study (weekly average viral concentration 0.6 copies/L) and occasionally other respiratory viruses. Overall daily average CO2 levels were 1,064 ± 232 ppm (± standard deviation). Daily average aerosol number concentrations without interventions were 177 ± 109 1/cm3 and decreased by 69\% (95\% CrI 42\% to 86\%) with mask mandates and 39\% (95\% CrI 4\% to 69\%) with air cleaners. Compared to no intervention, the transmission risk was lower with mask mandates (adjusted odds ratio 0.19, 95\% CrI 0.09 to 0.38) and comparable with air cleaners (1.00, 95\% CrI 0.15 to 6.51). Study limitations include possible confounding by period as the number of susceptible students declined over time. Furthermore, airborne detection of pathogens document exposure but not necessarily transmission. Conclusions Molecular detection of airborne and human SARS-CoV-2 indicated sustained transmission in schools. Mask mandates were associated with greater reductions in aerosol concentrations than air cleaners and with lower transmission. Our multiple-measurement approach could be used to continuously monitor transmission risk of respiratory infections and the effectiveness of infection control measures in schools and other congregate settings.},

In either case, an accurate estimation of dose and sites of deposition in the respiratory tract is fundamental to understanding subsequent biological response, and the basic physics of particle motion and engineering knowledge needed to understand these subjects is the topic of this chapter., A large portion of this chapter deals with three fundamental areas necessary to the understanding of particle transport and deposition in the respiratory tract. These are: 1) the physical characteristics of particles, 2) particle behavior in gas flow, and 3) gas flow patterns in the respiratory tract.

	abstract = {Background The size and concentration of exhaled bioaerosols may influence TB transmission risk. This study piloted bioaerosol measurement in patients with TB and assessed variability in bioaerosol production during normal tidal breathing. Understanding this may provide a tool for assessing heterogeneity in infectivity and may inform mathematical models of TB control practices and policies.
Methods Optical particle counter technology was used to measure aerosol size and concentration in exhaled air (range 0.3–20 µm in diameter) during 15 tidal breaths across four groups over time: healthy/uninfected, healthy/Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected, patients with extrathoracic TB and patients with intrathoracic TB. High-particle production was defined as any 1–5 µm sized bioaerosol count above the median count among all participants (median count=2 counts/L).
Results Data from 188 participants were obtained pretreatment (baseline). Bioaerosol production varied considerably between individuals. Multivariable analysis showed intrathoracic TB was associated with a 3½-fold increase in odds of high production of 1–5 µm bioaerosols (adjusted OR: 3.5; 95\% CI 1.6 to 7.8; p=0.002) compared with healthy/uninfected individuals.
Conclusions We provide the first evidence that intrathoracic TB increases bioaerosol production in a particle size range that could plausibly transport M. tuberculosis. There is substantial variation in production within patients with TB that may conceivably relate to the degree of infectivity. Further data is needed to determine if high bioaerosol production during tidal breathing is associated with infectiousness.},

The distribution of pathological lesions, which are concentrated in the respiratory system, and the very low dose of Mycobacterium bovis needed to initiate infection from a respiratory tract challenge suggest that the disease is spread by airborne transmission. Critical to the airborne transmission of a pathogenic microorganism is its ability to survive the stresses incurred whilst airborne. This study demonstrates that M. bovis is resistant to the stresses imposed immediately after becoming airborne, 94\% surviving the first 10min after aerosolisation. Once airborne the organism is robust, its viability decreasing with a half-life of approximately 1.5hours.

	abstract = {Natural human exhalation flows such as coughing, sneezing and breathing can be considered as ‘jet-like’ airflows in the sense that they are produced from a single source in a single exhalation effort, with a relatively symmetrical, conical geometry. Although coughing and sneezing have garnered much attention as potential, explosive sources of infectious aerosols, these are relatively rare events during daily life, whereas breathing is necessary for life and is performed continuously. Real-time shadowgraph imaging was used to visualise and capture high-speed images of healthy volunteers sneezing and breathing (through the nose – nasally, and through the mouth - orally). Six volunteers, who were able to respond to the pepper sneeze stimulus, were recruited for the sneezing experiments (2 women: 27.5±6.36 years; 4 men: 29.25±10.53 years). The maximum visible distance over which the sneeze plumes (or puffs) travelled was 0.6 m, the maximum sneeze velocity derived from these measured distances was 4.5 m/s. The maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) area of dissemination of these sneezes was 0.2 m2. The corresponding derived parameter, the maximum 2-D area expansion rate of these sneezes was 2 m2/s. For nasal breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.6 m and 1.4 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.11 m2 and 0.16 m2/s, respectively. Similarly, for mouth breathing, the maximum propagation distance and derived velocity were 0.8 m and 1.3 m/s, respectively. The maximum 2-D area of dissemination and derived expansion rate were 0.18 m2 and 0.17 m2/s, respectively. Surprisingly, a comparison of the maximum exit velocities of sneezing reported here with those obtained from coughing (published previously) demonstrated that they are relatively similar, and not extremely high. This is in contrast with some earlier estimates of sneeze velocities, and some reasons for this difference are discussed.},

Methods Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. Coughing bouts were generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650, 320, and 220L/min to simulate normal, mild and poor coughing efforts, respectively. The coughing jet was revealed by laser light-sheet and images were captured by high definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. Significant exposure was arbitrarily defined where there was ≥ 20\% of normalized smoke concentration. Results During normal cough, expelled air dispersion distances were 68, 30 and 15 cm along the median sagittal plane when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. In moderate lung injury, the corresponding air dispersion distances for mild coughing efforts were reduced to 55, 27 and 14 cm, respectively, p {\textless} 0.001. The distances were reduced to 30, 24 and 12 cm, respectively during poor coughing effort as in severe lung injury. Lateral dispersion distances during normal cough were 0, 28 and 15 cm when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask, respectively. Conclusions Normal cough produced a turbulent jet about 0.7 m towards the end of the bed from the recumbent subject. N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage.},

	abstract = {Various infectious agents are known to be transmitted naturally via respiratory aerosols produced by infected patients. Such aerosols may be produced during normal activities by breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing. The schlieren optical method, previously applied mostly in engineering and physics, can be effectively used here to visualize airflows around human subjects in such indoor situations, non-intrusively and without the need for either tracer gas or airborne particles. It accomplishes this by rendering visible the optical phase gradients owing to real-time changes in air temperature. In this study, schlieren video records are obtained of human volunteers coughing with and without wearing standard surgical and N95 masks. The object is to characterize the exhaled airflows and evaluate the effect of these commonly used masks on the fluid-dynamic mechanisms that spread infection by coughing. Further, a high-speed schlieren video of a single cough is analysed by a computerized method of tracking individual turbulent eddies, demonstrating the non-intrusive velocimetry of the expelled airflow. Results show that human coughing projects a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air, but that wearing a surgical or N95 mask thwarts this natural mechanism of transmitting airborne infection, either by blocking the formation of the jet (N95 mask), or by redirecting it in a less harmful direction (surgical mask).},

However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaled aerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza. We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (“coarse”{\textgreater}5 µm, “fine”≤5 µm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95\% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95\% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95\% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95\% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding. Correlations between nasopharyngeal swab and the aerosol fraction copy numbers were weak (r = 0.17, coarse; r = 0.29, fine fraction). Copy numbers in exhaled breath declined rapidly with day after onset of illness. Two subjects with the highest copy numbers gave culture positive fine particle samples. Surgical masks worn by patients reduce aerosols shedding of virus. The abundance of viral copies in fine particle aerosols and evidence for their infectiousness suggests an important role in seasonal influenza transmission. Monitoring exhaled virus aerosols will be important for validation of experimental transmission studies in humans.},

	issn = {2059-7908},
	doi = {10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007136},
	abstract = {Background
There is a high risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in healthcare facilities in high burden settings. WHO guidelines on tuberculosis (TB) infection prevention and control (IPC) recommend a range of measures to reduce transmission in healthcare settings. These were evaluated primarily based on evidence for their effects on transmission to healthcare workers in hospitals. To estimate the overall impact of IPC interventions, it is necessary to also consider their impact on community-wide TB incidence and mortality.

Methods
We developed an individual-based model of Mtb transmission in households, primary healthcare (PHC) clinics, and all other congregate settings. The model was parameterised using data from a high HIV prevalence community in South Africa, including data on social contact by setting, by sex, age, and HIV/antiretroviral therapy status; and data on TB prevalence in clinic attendees and the general population. We estimated the proportion of disease in adults that resulted from transmission in PHC clinics, and the impact of a range of IPC interventions in clinics on community-wide TB.

Results
We estimate that 7.6\% (plausible range 3.9\%–13.9\%) of non-multidrug resistant and multidrug resistant TB in adults resulted directly from transmission in PHC clinics in the community in 2019. The proportion is higher in HIV-positive people, at 9.3\% (4.8\%–16.8\%), compared with 5.3\% (2.7\%–10.1\%) in HIV-negative people. We estimate that IPC interventions could reduce incident TB cases in the community in 2021–2030 by 3.4\%–8.0\%, and deaths by 3.0\%–7.2\%.

Conclusions
A non-trivial proportion of TB results from transmission in clinics in the study community, particularly in HIV-positive people. Implementing IPC interventions could lead to moderate reductions in disease burden. We recommend that IPC measures in clinics should be implemented for their benefits to staff and patients, but also for their likely effects on TB incidence and mortality in the surrounding community.},

	abstract = {Background
Since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, scientific exploration of infection control is no longer restricted to microbiologists or medical scientists. Many studies have reported on the release, transport, and exposure of expiratory droplets because of respiratory activities. This review focuses on the airborne spread of infectious agents from mucus to mucus in the indoor environment and their spread as governed by airflows in the respiratory system, around people, and in buildings at different transport stages.
Methods
We critically review the literature on the release of respiratory droplets, their transport and dispersion in the indoor environment, and the ultimate exposure of a susceptible host, as influenced by airflows.
Results
These droplets or droplet nuclei are transported by expired airflows, which are sometimes affected by the human body plume and use of a face mask, as well as room airflow. Room airflow is affected by human activities such as walking and door opening, and some droplets are eventually captured by a susceptible individual because of his or her inspired flows; such exposure can eventually lead to long-range spread of airborne pathogens. Direct exposure to the expired fine droplets or droplet nuclei results in short-range airborne transmission. Deposition of droplets and direct personal exposure to expired large droplets can lead to the fomite route and the droplet-borne route, respectively.
Conclusions
We have shown the opportunities for infection control at different stages of the spread. We propose that the short-range airborne route may be important in close contact, and its control may be achieved by face masks for the source patients and use of personalized ventilation. Our discussion of the effect of thermal stratification and expiratory delivery of droplets leads to the suggestion that displacement ventilation may not be applicable to hospital rooms where respiratory infection is a concern.},

	abstract = {Background: Placing a surgical mask on an infected patient (respiratory source control) may offer a health-care worker (HCW) more protection than donning an N95 respirator (receiver protection). This observation was made in an in vitro study that used hard, nondeformable faces, and the lack of proper N95 fit may have accounted for the observed results. In the present study, we test the effects of fit on respiratory source control protection, using a soft, deformable mannequin head.

Methods: Resusci Anne CPR mannequin heads were placed in a chamber allowing 6 air exchanges/hr (14 cubic feet per minute), to simulate an infected patient (source) and an HCW (receiver). The heads were ventilated with a tidal breathing pattern. The source exhaled radioactive aerosols, and a filter was attached to the receiver to quantify inhaled exposure. N95 respirators and surgical masks were tested on both heads. The degree of protection was expressed by calculating the reduction in exposure expressed as a simulated workplace protection factor (sWPF; the ratio of exposure with mask to exposure without mask) compared statistically using confidence intervals.

Results: Use of the Resusci Anne heads resulted in improved fit, with higher sWPF than previously reported, for example, for source N95 mask combinations (7,174 vs. 317) as well as receiver (7.53 vs. 1.37). Masks placed on the receiver provided minimal exposure protection (sWPF range 0.99–7.53), except when sealed with Vaseline (sWPF 63.1). Any mask applied to the source mannequin resulted in significant reductions in exposure (sWPF range 214–17,038).

Conclusion: Improved fit significantly enhanced the effects of source control protection. A Vaseline-sealed N95 respirator on the receiver offered less protection when compared with any mask on the source. Respiratory source control can offer more protection to HCW and potentially decrease the spread of aerosolized infections.},

METHODS: We collected indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) data from markets, prisons, night clubs, public transportation, religious and social halls, and from schools. Study volunteers recorded social contacts at each of the locations. We then estimated the annual risks of TB transmission using a modified Wells-Riley equation for different locations. RESULTS: The annual risks of TB transmission were highest among prison inmates (41.6\%) and drivers (20.3\%) in public transport. Lower transmission risks were found in central markets (4.8\% for traders, but 0.5\% for their customers), passengers on public transport (2.4\%), public schools (4.0\%), nightclubs (1.7\%), religious (0.13\%), and social halls (0.12\%).

	abstract = {Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized, the condition of ventilation for its occurrence is still being debated. We analyzed a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak involving three families in a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, assessed the possibility of airborne transmission, and characterized the associated environmental conditions. We collected epidemiological data, obtained a full video recording and seating records from the restaurant, and measured the dispersion of a warm tracer gas as a surrogate for exhaled droplets from the index case. Computer simulations were performed to simulate the spread of fine exhaled droplets. We compared the in-room location of subsequently infected cases and spread of the simulated virus-laden aerosol tracer. The ventilation rate was measured using the tracer gas concentration decay method. This outbreak involved ten infected persons in three families (A, B, C). All ten persons ate lunch at three neighboring tables at the same restaurant on January 24, 2020. None of the restaurant staff or the 68 patrons at the other 15 tables became infected. During this occasion, the measured ventilation rate was 0.9 L/s per person. No close contact or fomite contact was identified, aside from back-to-back sitting in some cases. Analysis of the airflow dynamics indicates that the infection distribution is consistent with a spread pattern representative of long-range transmission of exhaled virus-laden aerosols. Airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is possible in crowded space with a ventilation rate of 1 L/s per person.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In South Africa, it is generally estimated that only 0.5–0.6\% of people's contacts occur in clinics. Both people with infectious tuberculosis and people with increased susceptibility to disease progression may spend more time in clinics, however, increasing
the importance of clinic-based transmission to overall disease incidence.
METHODS: We developed an illustrative mathematical model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in clinics and other settings. We assumed that 1\% of contact time occurs in clinics. We varied the
ratio of clinic contact time of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive people compared to HIV-negative people, and of people with infectious TB compared to people without TB, while keeping the overall proportion of contact time occurring in clinics, and each person's total contact time,
constant.
RESULTS: With clinic contact rates respectively 10 and 5 times higher in HIV-positive people and people with TB, 10.7\% (plausible range 8.5–13.4\%) of TB resulted from transmission in clinics. With contact rates in HIV-positive people and people with TB respectively
5 and 2 times higher, 5.3\% (plausible range 4.3–6.3\%) of all TB was due to transmission in clinics.
CONCLUSION: The small amount of contact time that generally occurs in clinics may greatly underestimate their contribution to TB disease in high TB-HIV burden settings.},

DESIGN: T-cell-mediated immunity is recognized as one of the mechanisms of defence against TB. The cellular immunodeficiency and the importance of TB in the context of HIV disease has prompted use of in vitro assays of lymphocyte proliferation and cytolytic activity.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 29 HIV-infected patients (four with recent TB) and 11 healthy volunteers were stimulated with purified protein derivative (PPD). The responding blasts were presented to autologous antigen-primed macrophages to measure specific cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity in vitro.
RESULTS: T-cell proliferative responses were significantly lower in late stages of HIV disease. The degree of specific CTL activity was higher in healthy individuals than in Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage II-III (P = 0.037), and CDC stage IV patients (P = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical presentation of TB tends to be typical in early stages of HIV disease and atypical in late stages. The manifestations reflect the degree of immunodepression.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
RESULTS:
M. tuberculosis was detected in 3 of
99 (3.0\%, 95\%CI 0.6–8.6) areas: one sputum collection room and one TB in-patient room in one facility and one sputum collection room in another facility. In these three areas, the M. tuberculosis copy number/m3 ranged from 9.6 to 1671. Lower air change rate ({\textless}6 h−1),
higher relative humidity ({\textgreater}65\%), and contact with coughing patient(s) were more common in airborne M. tuberculosis-positive areas than in M. tuberculosis-negative areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Air sampling using a liquid impinger followed by real-time qPCR is effective for
quantitative detection of airborne M. tuberculosis in high-risk areas. Our findings indicate TB risk among health care workers, and suggest that improved ventilation, enhanced appropriate cough etiquette and respiratory protection are needed to mitigate M. tuberculosis transmission.},

	abstract = {Background
Symptoms of infectious respiratory illnesses are often assumed to drive transmission. However, production and release of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bioaerosols is poorly understood. We report quantitation of Mtb exhaled during specific respiratory manoeuvres.
Methods
Direct capture of nascent bioaerosol particles and indirect collection of aged particles was performed in 10 healthy subjects. Indirect and direct capture of exhaled viable Mtb bacilli was compared in 38 PTB patients and directly captured viable Mtb during cough and bronchiole-burst manoeuvres in 27 of the PTB patients.
Results
Direct sampling of healthy subjects captured larger bioaerosol volumes with higher proportions of 2–5 μm particles than indirect sampling. Indirect sampling identified viable Mtb in 92.1\% (35 of 38) of PTB patients during 60-min relaxed breathing, median bacillary count 7.5 (IQR: 3.25–19). Direct sampling for 10-min identified Mtb in 97.4\% (37 of 38) of PTB patients with higher bacilli counts (p {\textless} 0.001), median 24.5 (IQR:11.25–37.5). A short 5-min sampling regimen of 10 coughs or 10 bronchiole-burst manoeuvres yielded a median of 11 (IQR: 4–17) and 11 (IQR: 7–17.5) Mtb bacilli, respectively (p = 0.53).
Conclusions
Peripheral lung bioaerosol released through deep exhalations alone contained viable Mtb suggesting non-cough transmission is possible in PTB.},

South Africa.DESIGN: Carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors were placed inside eight public buildings. Measurements were used with observations of occupancy to estimate infection risk using an adaptation of the Wells-Riley equation. Ventilation modelling using CONTAM was used to examine
the impact of low-cost retrofits on transmission in a health clinic.RESULTS: Measurements indicate that infection risk in the church, classroom and clinic waiting room would be high with typical ventilation, occupancy levels and visit durations. For example, we estimated that health care
workers in a clinic waiting room had a 16.9–24.5\% annual risk of M. tuberculosis infection. Modelling results indicate that the simple addition of two new windows allowing for cross-ventilation, at a cost of US\$330, would reduce the annual risk to health care workers by
57\%.CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that public buildings in this community have a range of ventilation and occupancy characteristics that may influence transmission risks. Simple retrofits may result in dramatic reductions in M. tuberculosis transmission, and intervention studies
should therefore be considered.},

Exogenous factors play a key role in accentuating the progression from exposure to infection among which the bacillary load in the sputum and the proximity of an individual to an infectious TB case are key factors. Similarly endogenous factors lead in progression from infection to active TB disease. Along with well-established risk factors (such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malnutrition, and young age), emerging variables such as diabetes, indoor air pollution, alcohol, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and tobacco smoke play a significant role at both the individual and population level. Socioeconomic and behavioral factors are also shown to increase the susceptibility to infection. Specific groups such as health care workers and indigenous population are also at an increased risk of TB infection and disease.
